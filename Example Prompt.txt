A complex positioning system for models inside wind tunnels. It will be using 6 stepped motors to control each of these axis. Roll, pitch and yaw should be controlled by degrees forward sideways up-down should be controlled in mm. each axis should have a max speed, acceleration and deceleration. All of these positions are measured by encoders to ensure that the steps match up with the real position and should be fed back to the delphi GUI. There will also be gearboxes so the gear ratio needs to be accounted for in the backend.
